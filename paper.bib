abstract = {Our physics-inspired algorithm for symbolic regression is able to discover complex physics equations from mere tables of numbers. A core challenge for both physics and artificial intelligence (AI) is symbolic regression: finding a symbolic expression that matches data from an unknown function. Although this problem is likely to be NP-hard in principle, functions of practical interest often exhibit symmetries, separability, compositionality, and other simplifying properties. In this spirit, we develop a recursive multidimensional symbolic regression algorithm that combines neural network fitting with a suite of physics-inspired techniques. We apply it to 100 equations from the Feynman Lectures on Physics, and it discovers all of them, while previous publicly available software cracks only 71; for a more difficult physics-based test set, we improve the state-of-the-art success rate from 15 to 90\%.}}

abstract={Discovering a meaningful symbolic expression that explains experimental data is a fundamental challenge in many scientific fields. We present a novel, open-source computational framework called Scientist-Machine Equation Detector (SciMED), which integrates scientific discipline wisdom in a scientist-in-the-loop approach, with state-of-the-art symbolic regression (SR) methods. SciMED combines a wrapper selection method, that is based on a genetic algorithm, with automatic machine learning and two levels of SR methods. We test SciMED on five configurations of a settling sphere, with and without aerodynamic non-linear drag force, and with excessive noise in the measurements. We show that SciMED is sufficiently robust to discover the correct physically meaningful symbolic expressions from the data, and demonstrate how the integration of domain knowledge enhances its performance. Our results indicate better performance on these tasks than the state-of-the-art SR software packages , even in cases where no knowledge is integrated. Moreover, we demonstrate how SciMED can alert the user about possible missing features, unlike the majority of current SR systems.},

                    of models with constraints is worse on the training set and the test set.

Knowledge of the relationship between the porous structure and overall mechanical properties is thus essential for the wide potential applications{,} and the existing challenge is to efficiently predict and design the mechanical properties of porous graphene due to the diverse nanopore arrangements. In this work{,} we report on how the SISSO (Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator) algorithm can be applied to build a bridge between the mechanical properties of porous graphene and the uniform nanopore array. We first construct a database using the strength and work of fracture calculated by large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. Then the SISSO algorithm is adopted to train a predictive model and automatically derive the optimal fitting formulae which explicitly describe the nonlinear structure–property relationships. These expressions not only enable the direct and accurate prediction of targeted properties{,} but also serve as a convenient and portable tool for inverse design of the porous structure. Compared with other forecasting methods including several popular machine learning algorithms{,} the SISSO algorithm shows its advantages in both accuracy and convenience."}

abstract = {We construct a physics-aware AI model that integrates the advanced reasoning, rational thinking, and strategic planning capabilities of large language models with the ability to write and execute code, perform atomistic simulations to solicit new physics data, and conduct visual analysis of graphed data and molecular mechanisms. By employing a multiagent strategy, these capabilities are combined into an intelligent system designed to solve complex analysis and design tasks, as applied here to alloy design and discovery. The design of new alloys is a multiscale problem that requires a holistic approach that involves retrieving relevant knowledge, applying advanced computational methods, conducting experimental validations, and analyzing the results, a process that is typically slow and reserved for human experts. Machine learning can help accelerate this process, for instance, through the use of deep surrogate models that connect structural and chemical features to material properties, or vice versa. However, existing data-driven models often target specific material objectives, offering limited flexibility to integrate out-of-domain knowledge and cannot adapt to new, unforeseen challenges. Here, we overcome these limitations by leveraging the distinct capabilities of multiple AI agents that collaborate autonomously within a dynamic environment to solve complex materials design tasks. The proposed physics-aware generative AI platform, AtomAgents, synergizes the intelligence of large language models (LLMs) and the dynamic collaboration among AI agents with expertise in various domains, including knowledge retrieval, multimodal data integration, physics-based simulations, and comprehensive results analysis across modalities. The concerted effort of the multiagent system allows for addressing complex materials design problems, as demonstrated by examples that include autonomously designing metallic alloys with enhanced properties compared to their pure counterparts. Our results enable accurate prediction of key characteristics across alloys and highlight the crucial role of solid solution alloying to steer the development of advanced metallic alloys. Our framework enhances the efficiency of complex multiobjective design tasks and opens avenues in fields such as biomedical materials engineering, renewable energy, and environmental sustainability.}}

abstract={Symbolic regression (SR) has emerged as a powerful tool for automated scientific discovery, enabling the derivation of governing equations from experimental data. A growing body of work illustrates the promise of integrating domain knowledge into the SR to improve the discovered equation's generality and usefulness. Physics-informed SR (PiSR) addresses this by incorporating domain knowledge, but current methods often require specialized formulations and manual feature engineering, limiting their adaptability only to domain experts. In this study, we leverage pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate knowledge integration in PiSR. By harnessing the contextual understanding of LLMs trained on vast scientific literature, we aim to automate the incorporation of domain knowledge, reducing the need for manual intervention and making the process more accessible to a broader range of scientific problems. Namely, the LLM is integrated into the SR's loss function, adding a term of the LLM's evaluation of the SR's produced equation. We extensively evaluate our method using three SR algorithms (DEAP, gplearn, and PySR) and three pre-trained LLMs (Falcon, Mistral, and LLama 2) across three physical dynamics (dropping ball, simple harmonic motion, and electromagnetic wave). The results demonstrate that LLM integration consistently improves the reconstruction of physical dynamics from data, enhancing the robustness of SR models to noise and complexity. We further explore the impact of prompt engineering, finding that more informative prompts significantly improve performance.},

abstract = {Symbolic regression (SR) is the study of algorithms that automate the search for analytic expressions that fit data. While recent advances in deep learning have generated renewed interest in such approaches, the development of SR methods has not been focused on physics, where we have important additional constraints due to the units associated with our data. Here we present Φ-SO, a physical symbolic optimization framework for recovering analytical symbolic expressions from physics data using deep reinforcement learning techniques by learning units constraints. Our system is built, from the ground up, to propose solutions where the physical units are consistent by construction. This is useful not only in eliminating physically impossible solutions but also because the grammatical rules of dimensional analysis enormously restrict the freedom of the equation generator, thus vastly improving performance. The algorithm can be used to fit noiseless data, which can be useful, for instance, when attempting to derive an analytical property of a physical model, and it can also be used to obtain analytical approximations of noisy data. We test our machinery on a standard benchmark of equations from the Feynman Lectures on Physics and other physics textbooks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the presence of noise (exceeding 0.1%) and show that it is robust even in the presence of substantial (10%) noise. We showcase its abilities on a panel of examples from astrophysics.}

We here propose a combinatorial machine-learning approach to obtain physical formulas based on simple and easily accessible ingredients, such as atomic properties. The latter are used to build materials features that are finally employed, through linear regression, to predict the energetic stability of semiconducting binary compounds with respect to zinc blende and rocksalt crystal structures. The adopted models are trained using a dataset built from first-principles calculations. Our results show that already one-dimensional (1D) formulas well describe the energetics; a simple grid-search optimization of the automatically obtained 1D-formulas enhances the prediction performance at a very small computational cost. In addition, our approach allows one to highlight the role of the different atomic properties involved in the formulas. The computed formulas clearly indicate that “spatial” atomic properties (i.e., radii indicating maximum probability densities for s,p,d electronic shells) drive the stabilization of one crystal structure with respect to the other, suggesting the major relevance of the radius associated with the p-shell of the cation species.},

Low ion mobility is, for example, one of the major factors reducing the range of battery-electric vehicles in winter. On the other hand, with respect to the ion mobility in battery cathode materials, there are scaling relations linking large insertion energies and thus high voltages with high migration barriers corresponding to low ion mobility. Consequently, a compromise has to be made between these two conflicting properties. In this opinion, we will address how computational screening and the identification of descriptors can accelerate the search for solid battery materials with improved ion migration properties, but we will also discuss how the scaling relations linking reaction and activation energies might be overcome.}

    abstract = {Cathodes are critical components of rechargeable batteries. Conventionally, the search for cathode materials relies on experimental trial-and-error and a traversing of existing computational/experimental databases. While these methods have led to the discovery of several commercially viable cathode materials, the chemical space explored so far is limited and many phases will have been overlooked, in particular, those that are metastable. We describe a computational framework for battery cathode exploration based on ab initio random structure searching (AIRSS), an approach that samples local minima on the potential energy surface to identify new crystal structures. We show that by delimiting the search space using a number of constraints, including chemically aware minimum interatomic separations, cell volumes, and space group symmetries, AIRSS can efficiently predict both thermodynamically stable and metastable cathode materials. Specifically, we investigate LiCoO2, LiFePO4, and LixCuyFz to demonstrate the efficiency of the method by rediscovering the known crystal structures of these cathode materials. The effect of parameters, such as minimum separations and symmetries, on the efficiency of the sampling is discussed in detail. The adaptation of the minimum interatomic distances on a species-pair basis, from low-energy optimized structures to efficiently capture the local coordination environment of atoms, is explored. A family of novel cathode materials based on the transition-metal oxalates is proposed. They demonstrate superb energy density, oxygen-redox stability, and lithium diffusion properties. This article serves both as an introduction to the computational framework and as a guide to battery cathode material discovery using AIRSS.},

However, the program does not become more tractable if this method is used, since Benders' cuts are quadratic in the integer variables. A new equivalent formulation that renders the program tractable is developed, under which the dual objective function is linear in the integer variables and the dual constraint set is independent of these variables. Benders' cuts that are derived from the new formulation are linear in the integer variables, and the original problem is decomposed into a series of integer linear master problems and standard quadratic subproblems. The new formulation does not introduce new primary variables or new constraints into the computational steps of the decomposition algorithm.},

abstract = {The training of a support vector machine (SVM) has the time complexity of O(n3) with data number n. Normal SVM algorithms are not suitable for classification of large data sets. Convex hull can simplify SVM training, however the classification accuracy becomes lower when there are inseparable points. This paper introduces a novel method for SVM classification, called convex–concave hull. After grid pre-processing, the convex hull and the concave (non-convex) hull are found by Jarvis march method. Then the vertices of the convex–concave hull are applied for SVM training. The proposed convex–concave hull SVM classifier has distinctive advantages on dealing with large data sets with higher accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach has good classification accuracy while the training is significantly faster than the other training methods.}
